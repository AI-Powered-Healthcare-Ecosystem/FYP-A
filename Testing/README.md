## Quick Start

1. **Open the website**: Simply open `treatment-recommendation.html` in your web browser

## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ treatment-recommendation.html  # Treatment recommendation page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lifestyle-guidance.html       # Lifestyle guidance page  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css                   # Comprehensive styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js                    # Interactive functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BACKEND_API_STRUCTURE.md     # Backend implementation guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # This file
```

## Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to work with a RESTful API backend. See `BACKEND_API_STRUCTURE.md` for:
- Complete API endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- RAG system integration requirements
- Database schema suggestions
- Security and deployment considerations

### API Configuration
Update the API configuration in `script.js`:
```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
    baseUrl: 'http://your-backend-url/api',
    endpoints: {
        treatmentRecommendation: '/treatment-recommendation',
        lifestyleGuidance: '/lifestyle-guidance'
    }
};
```

## Testing Mode

The current implementation includes mock responses for testing the interface without a backend. The forms will:
- Validate user input
- Show loading states
- Display formatted mock recommendations
- Demonstrate error handling

## Browser Compatibility
